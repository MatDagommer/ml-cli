## Version 0.1.4

This release focuses on improving development workflows and code quality checks, as well as enhancing documentation for contributors. It also includes a fix to the CI pipeline to ensure publishing errors are properly reported.

### New Features

- Added the interrogate pre-commit hook with custom configuration, using pyproject.toml and excluding the docs/ and tests/ directories from checks. (9d6573) (MatDagommer)
- Upgraded pre-commit configuration: added black and vulture hooks, updated ruff and interrogate versions, and removed nbstripout and pydoclint. (92cab2) (MatDagommer)
- Added AGENTS.md with instructions for using llamabot and pre-commit tools. (92cab2) (MatDagommer)
- Bumped pyml-cli version to 0.1.3 in pixi.lock and updated its sha256 hash. (92cab2) (MatDagommer)

### Bug Fixes

- Removed the unconditional success fallback ('|| true') from the PyPI publish step in CI, so publishing failures are no longer silently ignored. (1f3da7) (MatDagommer)

### Deprecations

- None in this release.
